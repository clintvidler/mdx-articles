The following command will establish an SSH connection to your web server using Terminal.

```bash
ssh ssh://<username>@<server-address>:<port>
```

Requires two previous steps:

1. Grant SSH access permission on your host for your IP address.
2. Have uploaded and authorised (in cPanel) your public SSH key, which was [generated on your local machine](/posts/manage-ssh-keys).

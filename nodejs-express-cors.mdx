When attempting to access an API backend you will receive a CORS error if the appropriate headers aren’t configured on the http responses.

Blocking CORS is a default security feature of web browsers. Something you may not of encountered prior to attempting to decouple your front and backend servers. Here’s the error:

```bash
Access to XMLHttpRequest at ‘http://localhost:3030/’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource.
```

Initially you might think something’s wrong with the front-end request, this isn’t the case. There’s nothing to be done on the front-end to solve this. The issue is on the backend, and luckily it’s an easy fix.

Allowing CORS requires some headers be added to the backend http responses.

## Using NodeJS Express:

File: `app.js`

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  // You may also want to include other HTTP methods, PUT, PATCH, DELETE etc.
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST");
  res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type, Authorization");
  next();
});
```

## Using NPM Middleware:

A Node Middleware has been created specifically to make this task even easier.

From your CLI:

```bash
npm install cors --save
```

Include these line in your app.js file:

```js
// Near the top
const cors = require("cors");

// Somewhere after var app = express();
app.use(cors());
```

## Summary

This article has focused on dealing with CORS from a Node Express API, however the mentioned headers are relevant to any server side systems.

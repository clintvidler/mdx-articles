Make sure the following network is present in both containers 'docker-compose' file:

```yaml
networks:
  my_net:
    name: my_net
```

Then you can communicate using this format:

`container-name:8080/path/to/resource`

Where `container-name` is the container name and 8080 is the internal docker port, i.e. `external:8080` (external is the one used to access from the local machine).

```yaml
services:
  main:
    container_name: container-name
```

###### Resolving error/s:

- `dial tcp: lookup container-name on 127.0.0.11:53: no such host`

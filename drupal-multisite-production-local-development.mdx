_This article is yet to be completed, but stands to offer some useful information._

It doesn’t matter which version is created first, local or remote, but we start with the remote version.

## Create Drupal Multisite on the web server

### Create databases

Create the databases via cPanel.

### Install Drupal 9

SSH to the web server and navigate to the intended installation location (typically the domain folder).

```bash
# download and unzip the latest Drupal version
wget https://www.drupal.org/download-latest/zip
unzip zip

# move the folder to the root install location
mv -f drupal-9.x/{.,}\* /home/username/drupal.com.au

# create the settings.php file
cp sites/default/default.settings.php sites/default/settings.php
chmod a+w sites/default/settings.php
chmod a+w sites/default
```

Visit the URL and complete the wizard, using the already created databases. Add a database prefix, such as ‘drp\_’.

### Enable Multisite

```bash
# Create the sites.php file
cp sites/example.sites.php sites/sites.php
```

### Create additional site

Add the following to the bottom of 'sites/sites.php'

```bash
$sites['example.com.au'] = 'example.com.au';
```

Create a folder and settings.php for the site.

```bash
mkdir sites/example.com.au
cp sites/default/default.settings.php sites/example.com.au/settings.php
```

1. Create a subdomain the site (could also an add-on domain)
2. Delete the folder that was automatically created
3. Create a symbolic link in its place

```bash
# point the additional site to the root of the root site
ln -s ~/domain.com.au example.domain.com.au

# removing a symbolic link
unlink <path>
```

## Create a local development copy

### Export Drupal

Export a copy of the database into a folder in the Drupal installation folder, which will become part of the Git repo.

```bash
mysqldump -u username -p <db_name> > database/<db_name>.sql
```

Create a Git repo, adding all files and folders in the Drupal root.

### Import Drupal

Download the repo, and rename folder as desired.

Edit 'settings.php' for each site.

```php
$databases['default']['default'] = array (
  'database' => 'localdb',
  'username' => 'root',
  'password' => '',
  'prefix' => 'drp\_',
  'host' => '127.0.0.1',
  'port' => '3306',
  'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
  'driver' => 'mysql',
);
```

Import the site via devdesktop, specifying the folder location and using the exported SQL dump file.

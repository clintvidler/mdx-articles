'@eaDir' files provide extended directory attributes, much like the Windows 'thumbs.db' files or the Mac 'DS_Store' files. They take up unnecessary space and are a general frustration. Here’s how to get rid of them.

[Connect the your NAS via SSH](/posts/ssh-synology-nas)

## Find the @eaDir files

```bash
# sudo runs with root privileges requiring your password
sudo find . -name "@eaDir" -type d | more )
```

## Remove the @eaDir files

```bash
# sudo runs with root privileges requiring your password
sudo find . -name "@eaDir" -type d -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf
```

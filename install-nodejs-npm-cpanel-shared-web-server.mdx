NodeJS can be installed on you CPanel shared hosting plans, keep reading to see how.

```bash
npm --version
```

## NodeJS download

Visit [https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and copy the link to Linux 64-bit binary.

Connect to your web host via SSH, read [this article](/posts/ssh-to-webserver) if you’re not sure how.

Download the binaries to your home directory on the web server.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.5.0/node-v14.5.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
```

## Extract NodeJS

```bash
tar xvf node-v14.5.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
```

If your web server doesn’t have have the tools to handle .xz files, as indicated by the error below. You can look at installing xz-utils with apt-get. If your web server doesn’t have apt-get available, try the work around below.

```bash
tar (child): xz: Cannot exec: No such file or directory
tar (child): Error is not recoverable: exiting now
tar: Child returned status 2
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
```

**Workaround** (only if you can’t extract .xz files):

1. Download the binaries to your local machine
2. Extract to a folder
3. Compress the folder using .zip or something else the web server will handle
4. Upload the compressed file to the web server home directory
5. Uncompress $ unzip 'filename'.zip

## Install/Configure NodeJS

Now that you’ve downloaded the Linux binaries and extracted them into the home directory. Rename the extracted folder to something more friendly, such as “nodejs”.

```bash
mv node-v14.5.0-linux-x64 nodejs
```

```bash
mkdir ~/bin
cp nodejs/bin/node ~/bin
cd ~/bin
ln -s ../nodejs/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js npm
```

Now verify everything is working.

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

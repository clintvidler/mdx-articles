This proved much more difficult than it should have been, so I wrote this article.

```bash
$ drush --version
```

## Install Drush globally

The after installing Drush 10, the “Drush version” command would work anywhere except inside a Drupal instance, useless I know. I kept getting this error whenever I ran “drush xxx”, “[warning] Drush command terminated abnormally.”. I eventually I removed Drush 10 and installed Drush 9, problem solved.

```bash
composer global require drush/drush:9.x
```

Add path to '.bash_profile'

```bash
# edit .bash_profile
$ nano ~/.bash_profile

# add this line
PATH=$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH

# use newly modified .bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Update Drush globally

```bash
$ composer global update drush/drush
```

## Uninstall Drush

Maybe you will need this too.

```bash
$ composer global remove drush/drush
```

Alternate command:

```bash
composer require drush/drush
```

###### Troubleshooting

`Error: “[warning] Drush command terminated abnormally.”`. Was fixed by changing to a different version of Drush.

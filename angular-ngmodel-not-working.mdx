`[(ngModel)]` is not working on custom angular components

```html
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="term" />
```

The above doesn't work on custom components, but you can replace with the following:

```html
<input type="text" [value]="term" (input)="term = $event.target.value" />
```

or, an alternative without the need for a component property:

```html
<input
  matInput
  type="text"
  [value]="term || ''"
  (input)="term = $event.target.value"
/>
```

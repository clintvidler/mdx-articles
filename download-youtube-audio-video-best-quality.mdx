Download Youtube videos in highest quality available.

Install some required software:

```bash
# the downloader
brew install youtube-dl

# for merging audio and video
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Note:** Homebrew is a package manager for Mac only, you’ll need to find an alternative method for installing these libraries if you’re on Windows or Linux.

### Download audio and video to mp4

```bash
youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/bestvideo+bestaudio' 'the_url' --merge-output-format mp4
```

### Download audio only

```bash
youtube-dl -f 'bestaudio[ext=m4a]/bestaudio' --embed-thumbnail --add-metadata 'url'
```

### Downloads that require login

Download age restricted or private videos that require you to be logged in to YouTube.

Try adding your YouTube username and password to the command.

```bash
youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/bestvideo+bestaudio' -u 'your_email' -p 'your_password' 'the_url' --merge-output-format mp4
```

Alternatively (and more reliably), use your YouTube login cookie from the browser.

1. Visit the YouTube you want to download (while logged in and able to view the video)
2. Save the browser cookie to you files. Thirdparty extensions like “Get cookies.txt LOCALLY” may help.
3. Add the flag `–cookies ‘yt-cookies.txt’` to your command (assuming you renamed the text file)

Troubleshooting

If you’re still receiving these error/s your cookies may have expired, export them again.

Errors indicating that you need to do this:

```bash
ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden
```

```bash
WARNING: Unable to look up account info: HTTP Error 400: Bad Request
```

```bash
WARNING: unable to download video info webpage: HTTP Error 410: Gone
ERROR: Sign in to confirm your age

### More helpful and related utility

Use FFmpeg to convert mp4 to m4a without transcode.

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:a -c copy output.m4a
```

Bulk:

```bash
for file in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i "$file" -vn -c:a copy "output/$(basename "$file" .mp4).m4a"; done
```

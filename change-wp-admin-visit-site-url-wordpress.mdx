When creating a headless or decoupled Wordpress you may find that you want to change the Visit site link in the wp-admin bar to your chosen frontend.

This code sample can be added to your theme or child theme's 'function.php' file, or alternatively it may be put into a plugin.

```php
add_action( 'admin_bar_menu', 'func_admin_bar_menu', 80 );
function func_admin_bar_menu( $wp_admin_bar ) {
  // TODO: Read from URL definition in a theme option setting
  $frontendUrl = "http://localhost:3000/";

  // Change the frontend URL
  $siteName = $wp_admin_bar->get_node('site-name');
  $siteName->meta['target'] = '_blank';
  $siteName->href = $frontendUrl;
  $siteName->title = 'Visit the Frontend';
  $wp_admin_bar->add_node($siteName);

  // Remove the dropdown option for "Visit site", it's redundant
  $wp_admin_bar->remove_menu('view-site');
}
```

This method is better than a redirect to your frontend, it changes it within Wordpress.

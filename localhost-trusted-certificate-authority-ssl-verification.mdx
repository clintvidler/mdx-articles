Install mkcert; Create local certificate authority; Create certificates for your localhost application.

## Mac

Install mkcert using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install mkcert
brew install nss
```

Create local certificate authority (CA):

```bash
mkcert -install
```

Create certificates for your localhost application:

```bash
mkcert localhost localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

###### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Certificate is invalid. When clicking on the insecure warning next to the address bar to inspect the certificate it shows that it was issued by you computer with mkcert.

**Solution:** You may have missed the step to make mkcert a local CA.

## Manage SSH keys on a Mac (OSX)

The generated key consists of a pair of files, one private and one public. It’s very important that you **never share the private key**, ever. While you will use the public key to authenticate with the external service.

### Creating a key

To generate the key using the Terminal:

```bash
# Run the command below to generate an SSH key, then follow the prompts.
# Enter file location, or press enter to use the default location.
# Enter a passphrase, or press enter to for no passphrase. If you opt to use a passphrase you will need to enter it to use the key.
ssh-keygen
```

Now that the key can be copied to the clipboard ready for use:

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

**Bonus:** Add the following to your '.bash_profile' so you only need to type your passphrase when opening the terminal.

eval $(ssh-add)

### Removing a key

```bash
# Remove the private and public key, assuming the keys are in the default location
rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa && rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### Bonus config

Save servers for quick connection using, e.g.:

```bash
ssh myServer
```

Edit: '~/.ssh/config'

```bash
Host alias
  HostName hostname
  User user

Host myServer
  HostName 172.168.1.1
  User root
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## Manage SSH keys on Windows

The generated key consists of a pair of files, one private and one public. It’s very important that you **never share the private key**, ever. While you will use the public key to authenticate with the external service.

### Check for existing keys

Check for existing keys using command prompt:

```bash
# if you get "No such file or directory" then you don't have any keys
cd %userprofile%/.ssh

# if you get "File Not Found" then you don't have any key
dir id\_\*
```

If you already have an ssh key/s then you may like to reuse it. If you prefer not to, or don’t yet have an shh key then proceed to the next section.

### Creating a key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
```

(Press enter) when prompted to enter a file in which to save the key.

(Optional) enter a passphrase. I prefer to use one. Each time you connect to a service using the key you’ll be asked for this password.

**Note:** you must already have git installed with git bash for this command to work. You can [get git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) here.

```bash
# open the key with notepad ready to copy and paste for use
notepad id_rsa.pub
```

### Connect via SSH using Command Prompt

You’ll need to upload the public key to the service first.

```bash
ssh -l -p <port> <username>@<server>
```

Bulk URL redirecting that resembles the .htaccess method used for Apache.

## Installing the plugin

Firstly you need to install and include the plugin.

```bash
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-netlify
```

Include the plugin in your gatsby-config.js

```js
plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-netlify`];
```

## Creating the redirects

Netlify reads a file called “\_redirects” in the project root folder. The problem however is that placing the file in the root of the Gatsby application doesn’t work, so instead we place it in the /static folder. From here the file will be copied to the base Netlify folder.

Adding redirects:

File: `_redirects`

```js
/some-old-url /the-new-url
/another-old-url /the-new-url
```

**Notes:** Since this is supported by Netlify, it’s not going to work in your development environment.

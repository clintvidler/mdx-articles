How to create a reusable header component, containing a dynamic page title and sub-menu.

## The problem this article addresses

Say you have a site structure containing multiple pages, each with common information and management requirements. Take the structure shown below for example.

```
A SIMPLIFIED SITE STRUCTURE:

Home (/)
+-- Users (/users)
+-- +-- Index (/)
+-- +-- Single (/:id)
+-- +-- Create (/create)
+-- +-- Update (/:id/update)
+-- Organisations (/organisations)
+-- +-- Index (/)
+-- +-- Single (/:id)
+-- +-- Create (/create)
+-- +-- Update (/:id/update)
+-- Etc.
```

I want a reusable header component that can be used for users and organisations, it needs to:

- dynamically fill the page title (sometimes including the record ID)
- dynamically generate a sub-menu of actions (such as CRUD)

The image above show where the dynamic parts change based on the currently viewed route.

## Dynamic component content method

**Note:** The vue-router is required for this solution.

This approach stores relevant data inside its route, which is cleaner and makes more sense than using emit or the vuex state.

### The route

This is the users route, however the organisations route will use the same approach. Pay special attention to the use of ‘meta’, which is where the magic happens:

File: `@/routes/users.js`

```js
// import your components here

export default {
  path: "/users",
  component: Layout,
  meta: {
    // Navigation used in the header
    nav: [
      {
        id: 0,
        text: "View All",
        target: "/users",
        icon: "fas fa-list-ul",
      },
      {
        id: 1,
        text: "Create New",
        target: "/users/create",
        icon: "fas fa-edit",
      },
    ],
  },
  children: [
    {
      path: "",
      name: "UserIndex",
      component: Index,
      meta: {
        title: "All Users",
      },
    },
    {
      path: "create",
      name: "UserCreate",
      component: Form,
      meta: {
        title: "Create User",
      },
    },
    {
      path: "volunteers",
      name: "VolunteerIndex",
      component: Volunteers,
      meta: {
        title: "Volunteers",
      },
    },
    {
      path: ":id/update",
      name: "UserUpdate",
      component: Form,
      meta: {
        title: "Updating User: ", // ID will be appended using $router.To
      },
    },
    {
      path: ":id",
      name: "UserSingle",
      component: Single,
      meta: {
        title: "User: ",
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

The root layout for users:

File: `@/pages/layout.vue`

```
<template lang="pug">
  div(id='page')
    v-header
    router-view
</template>

<script>
  import Header from "@/components/Header";

  export default {
    components: {
      "v-header": Header,
    },
  };
</script>
```

The reusable header component:

File: `@/components/Header.vue`

```
<template lang='pug'>
  header
    div(id='main-header')
      div(class='container')
        h1 {{ title }}
          nav(id='page-nav' v-if='nav')
            ul
              li(v-for="item in nav" class="nav-link")
                router-link(:key="item.id" :to="`${item.target}`")
                  i(:class='item.icon')
                  span {{ item.text }}

</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    title: function () {
      return this.$route.meta.title + (this.$route.params.id ? this.$route.params.id : '')
    },
    nav: function () {
      return this.$route.matched[0].meta.nav
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Summary

We’ve created a reusable header, containing a dynamic title and navigation to child pages, which is then added to the root page layout of each model.

**Bonus:** this might also be used to create dynamic breadcrumbs, which is something I plan to explore in the future.

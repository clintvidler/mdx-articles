There are two main methods I use to run scripts from a PugJS template, a front-end method and a back-end method.

## Front-end method

This script will be processed on the front-end by the visitors browser.

```
script.
    console.log("Hello World!")
```

## Back-end method

This script will be processed on the backend, a console log will return in the application terminal.

```
- var count = 0
- console.log(count)
```
